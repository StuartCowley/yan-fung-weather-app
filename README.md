# React Weather Forecasting App

The weather forecasting application built with React and JSX.
- Users are able to see the name and country of the city the forecast is for.
- Users are able to see a summary of each day of the forecast, including the date, general description of the weather that day, and maximum temperature.
- Users are able to click on one of the summaries to view all of the forecasted information for that date.

This project is part of my bootcamp course at [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co/).
